            <p class="topParagraphText"><mark class = "italics">Continued Life</mark> is a reflection on repurposing waste materials consisting of a series of <mark>posters</mark> and a <mark>virtual reality</mark> environment. It’s an <mark>archive</mark> of the fleeting items passing through our lives, the emotion of holding on to them, and the anxiety of letting them go.</p>

                <p>The inevitability of <mark>wastes</mark> passing through our hands creates an urge for us to find new purposes to continue their lives.</p>
            
                <p><mark>Repurposing</mark> is a survival skill. My grandmother used a rope as a belt, tissue boxes as trash cans, yoghurt cups as planters, etc. There was a cabinet above the washing machine that contained everything yet to find a purpose. I was conditioned to value possessions in the same way as I was growing up.</p>
                
                <p>While in graduate school for graphic design, I started to observe the waste generated in the iterative process of learning and making, especially paper and plastic due to affordability. Out of habit, I would collect single-sided printer papers and use the white spaces for notes, practice calligraphy with markers over the writings, and then fold and cut them for prototyping. A piece of paper thus would have an extended lifetime, fully scribbled, and possibly stained.</p>

                <p>Archiving these items is an <mark>affirmation</mark> of sustainability practices on an individual level. The work would never be finished, however, for this project, three sets of items are documented: clothing, paper, and cups. The items are collected according to these <mark>criteria</mark>: 1) the item has an old purpose and a new, personally-defined purpose, 2) the item may be considered waste, and 3) the item has the potential to outlast its original lifetime.</p>
                    
                <p>Each set of items are photographed and abstracted into <mark>posters</mark>.</p>

                <p>The documented items are then modelled and imported into a <mark>virtual reality environment</mark>, where the visitor can look around and reflect on the destined disposal of objects and materials, drawing the conflict between wastefulness and letting go.</p>
